<br>
My name is Gahee Han, studying at Hanyang University(2016~). I have been studying foreign languages since I was very young, starting when I lived in Canada from 2005 to 2007. I studied English and French during elementary school years. After enrolling Daewon foreign language high school in Korea, I majored in Japanese. Now I am in Hanyang university majoring in Chinese Language and Literature. Even though I have spent almost half of my life mainly studying languages, my dream has been scientist and engineer. To pursue my dream before it gets too late, I started learning programming since 2018 May. I am now at an intermediate level of this area, and my focus is now on jumping into the next high level.
